AR Final for Core Collab

View and download the project for Android on Itch.io: https://torneberge.itch.io/ar-hwacha

Alternatively, use the Unity files here and hook it up to your webcam in the editor! Unfortunately, Vuforia (the AR plugin we used) isn't compatible with non-mobile devices yet. 

To get it to function properly, this project requires a wooden model, available here in Korea: http://youngmodeler.co.kr/shop/shopdetail.html?branduid=103&xcode=013&mcode=001&scode=&type=X&sort=&pre_idx=1&cur_code=&next=ok

I realize this is much less helpful for people not in Korea; I hope the video documentation gives a picture of what our app is like! There isn't too much more to it than what's in the video, really.
 
Thanks for checking out this page!
